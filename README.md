# SiC MOSFET-SBD Device Simulation and ML-Based Performance Prediction

## üìå Project Overview

This repository is my attempt to **implement the research paper**:

> **"SiC MOSFET with Integrated SBD Device Performance Prediction Method Based on Neural Network"**

The project demonstrates:
- **Device Simulation** of a SiC MOSFET integrated with a Schottky Barrier Diode (SBD) using Silvaco ATLAS.
- **Graphical Analysis** of device characteristics (Output, Input, Breakdown).
- **Generalized Simulation Automation** for 625 parameter variations (P-well doping, P-well depth, JFET width, SBD width).
- **Neural Network Model** to predict device performance parameters (Specific On-Resistance \(R_{on,sp}\), Threshold Voltage \(V_{th}\), Breakdown Voltage (BV)) from structural parameters.

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to **hardware limitations**, I could not execute all 625 simulations and train the ML model on the full dataset. However:
- The **entire pipeline is implemented**.
- The **machine learning architecture is fully written and functional**, ready to train on a dummy dataset or real data if generated.
- Anyone can **reuse this repository to run the full pipeline** on a high-performance machine.

## üìñ Journey

I began this project **at the end of July**, with **zero prior knowledge of Silvaco ATLAS**.  
Here's how the implementation progressed:

1. **Learning Silvaco from Scratch:**  
   - With no proper tutorials or guides available online, I relied solely on the **1200-page Silvaco manual**.  
   - Progress was slow and debugging was extremely challenging due to limited online support.

2. **Single Device Simulation:**  
   - Implemented the given SiC MOSFET with integrated SBD structure as described in the paper.
   - Extracted **I-V characteristics** and threshold voltage \(V_{th}\).  
   - The paper reported \(V_{th} = 6.101V\), whereas my simulation resulted in **5.0889V** because:
     - Some device parameters were not specified in the paper.
     - Computational limitations forced me to use **less coarse meshing**, affecting accuracy.

3. **Graph Generation:**  
   - Reproduced **Output Characteristics**, **Input Characteristics**, and **Breakdown Characteristics** as shown in the paper.
   - Scripts were written to automatically plot results from Silvaco simulation outputs.

4. **Generalized Simulation:**  
   - Developed a **parameter sweep automation program** to simulate 625 devices with varying:
     - P-well doping  
     - P-well depth  
     - JFET width  
     - SBD width  
   - The code is fully functional but could not be fully executed due to resource constraints (one simulation takes ~40 min on my machine).

5. **Machine Learning Model:**  
   - Implemented the **neural network architecture** exactly as proposed in the paper, with an enhanced feature extraction pipeline.
   - The model is fully written and can be trained on:
     - A **dummy dataset** (provided for testing the pipeline).
     - The **real dataset** once the 625 simulations are completed.

## üöß Challenges with Silvaco

Working with Silvaco ATLAS was one of the most challenging aspects of this project:

- **‚ùå Lack of Learning Resources:**  
  No proper tutorials or guides are available online for complex device simulations.  
  Most learning had to come from the **1200+ page manual**, making the process time-consuming.

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Debugging Issues:**  
  Errors are often cryptic and require multiple trial-and-error attempts to resolve.

- **‚è≥ Extremely Slow Simulations:**  
  Each device structure takes **30‚Äì40 minutes to simulate**, making large-scale parameter sweeps difficult on a personal machine.

## üìä Results (Single Device)

The following section compares the **results from the paper** with **my simulation results** for a single MOSFET.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Threshold Voltage \(V_{th}\)
- **Paper:** 6.101 V  
- **My Simulation:** 5.0889 V

‚ö†Ô∏è **Reason for Deviation:**  
- Missing some parameter definitions in the paper.  
- Computational limits forced me to use a **less fine mesh**, impacting accuracy.

## üß† Machine Learning Architecture ‚Äì SiC-SBD MOSFET Performance Prediction

This module implements the **neural network architecture** inspired by the research paper:

> **"SiC MOSFET with Integrated SBD Device Performance Prediction Method Based on Neural Network"**

The model predicts:

### **Pipeline to Use the ML Model**
1. Run `625_prediction.py` to generate 625 simulation input files with varying parameters:
   - Inputs: **Wjfet**, **Wsbd**, **P-well doping**, **P-well depth**  
2. Run the **Silvaco batch simulation code** to obtain `.csv` files with extracted parameters:
   - Outputs: **Specific ON-Resistance**, **Breakdown Voltage**, **Threshold Voltage**  
3. Run `engine.py`:
   - Trains the ML model on the dataset.
   - Prints **accuracy metrics**.
   - Saves the trained model for future predictions.
